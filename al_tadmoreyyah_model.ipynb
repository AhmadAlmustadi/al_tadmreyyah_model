        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to fine-tune the AraGPT2-large model on classical Islamic texts, specifically focusing on the book Al-Tadmuriyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. The goal is to have the model become highly specialized in predicting and generating text within this specific book, even if it leads to overfitting. Overfitting is acceptable and even encouraged for this task, as the primary objective is for the model to accurately represent and generate the unique language style and content of *Al-Tadmuriyah*.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, I have followed these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Collection: The text of Al-Tadmuriyah was scraped and processed for training. The code used for this scraping can be found on my [GitHub repository](#), and the processed dataset is available on Hugging Face datasets for public access.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. Model Selection: I used the AraGPT2-large model from Hugging Face, a powerful language model for Arabic. The model was quantized to 4-bit precision to reduce computational load while still retaining its performance potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Training and Fine-Tuning: I trained the model for 50 epochs, initially observing poor performance. To address this, I performed a grid search over several hyperparameters to identify the best configuration for this task.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Model Evaluation and Logs: The results from different configurations are logged and visualized using TensorBoard. All models generated from the grid search are available on my [Hugging Face repository](#).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What to Expect\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will find:\n",
        "- Details on the data preparation process, including how the dataset was scraped and preprocessed.\n",
        "- The fine-tuning steps applied to AraGPT2-large on Al-Tadmuriyah.\n",
        "- A discussion of the initial training results, followed by the grid search for optimal hyperparameters.\n",
        "- Insights into the performance of the model across different configurations, along with links to the trained models.\n",
        "- Logs and visualizations of the training process using TensorBoard.\n"

        "2. **Check if the `pad_token` exists**:\n",
        "   - If the `pad_token` (`'[PAD]'`) exists in the vocabulary, we remove it using the `pop()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rebuild the vocabulary**:\n",
        "   - After removing the `pad_token`, we rebuild the vocabulary (`new_vocab`) by creating a list of the remaining tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reinitialize the tokenizer without the `pad_token`**:\n",
        "   - We then recreate the tokenizer using the updated vocabulary that no longer includes the `pad_token` by calling `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Update the model configuration**:\n",
        "   - The model's configuration is updated by setting `pad_token_id` to `None`, ensuring that the model is no longer dependent on the padding token.\n",
        "   - We also adjust the model’s token embeddings to match the new vocabulary size using `resize_token_embeddings`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This process ensures that both the model and the tokenizer are in sync after removing the padding token, preventing any potential size mismatch errors when the model is used."

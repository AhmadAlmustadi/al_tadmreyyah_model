        "In this notebook, I build the final model for Al-Tadmuriyah using the best hyperparameter configuration identified through the grid search conducted in the previous notebooks. The goal here is to fine-tune the model to generate high-quality text closely aligned with the unique language style of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah as found in Al-Tadmuriyah.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging the optimal hyperparameters, I aim to maximize the model’s performance on this specialized dataset, allowing it to become proficient in predicting and generating text within the context of Al-Tadmuriyah. Once the model is trained, it is uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub, making it accessible for further experimentation and use by the broader community.\n",
